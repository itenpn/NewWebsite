  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <img class="headshot" src="../../assets/head.jpg"/>
  <p>My name is Paul Nicholas Iten, however, most people know me as Nicholas.
     I work part-time as an ice cream clerk at United Dairy Farmers and full-time as a student at Mason High School.
     At UDF I became one of the most trusted and important employees. Just ask one of UDFâ€™s variety of Marks such as
     Store Manager Mark or Milk Delivery Mark. At MHS my focus has been on computer science; I took the time to learn 
     over five programming languages this summer and hope to continuously add more to my repertoire. Currently I can 
     reasonably utilize VB.NET, C/C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Python, Rust, and Java. Outside of the traditional classroom 
     setting I participate in German National Honor Society (Ich kann etwas Deutsch sprechen) and Hack Club. You might also 
     find me volunteering for the Down Syndrome Association. I have a brother with down syndrome, so the organization holds 
     a special place in my heart. </p>
